#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
"""
Set up nightly ephemeral tasks via the reminder/scheduler system.

Creates five cron reminders that fire task.requested events:
1. Memory consolidation (script mode, 2:00am) - runs consolidate_3pass + consolidate_chat
2. Skillify analysis (agent mode, 2:10am) - runs /skillify --nightly
3. Quota scheduler (agent mode, 2:00am) - dynamically triggers bugfinder + latency finder
4. Sven Times gazette (agent mode, 2:40am) - generates daily gazette from system activity

Note: Vacation house scraper is registered separately via claude-assistant remind.

Usage:
    setup-nightly-tasks.py           # Add all reminders
    setup-nightly-tasks.py --list    # Show existing nightly task reminders
    setup-nightly-tasks.py --remove  # Remove existing nightly task reminders

# Sven Times daily gazette prompt
SVENTIMES_PROMPT = (
    "Generate today's edition of The Sven Times — a daily gazette of system activity.\n\n"
    "TONE & STYLE: Professional newspaper voice with understated wit. Third-person perspective. "
    "Write as if reporting on a complex technical system for an audience of engineers. "
    "Example lead: 'The messaging subsystem processed 400 inbound messages across eight active sessions "
    "yesterday, while a nightly consolidation pass merged conversation context for all contacts.'\n\n"
    "Steps:\n"
    "1. GATHER DATA: Run: uv run ~/code/svenflow.ai/scripts/gather-daily-data (defaults to today). "
    "This script already applies OPSEC filtering (blocklist, PII regex, IP/UUID redaction).\n\n"
    "2. READ TEMPLATE: Read ~/code/svenflow.ai/pages/times/index.html — replicate its exact HTML structure, CSS, and class names. "
    "Do NOT invent new structure; match what exists.\n\n"
    "3. READ BLOCKLIST: Read ~/code/svenflow.ai/scripts/opsec-blocklist.txt — this is the AUTHORITATIVE source of blocked terms. "
    "In addition to those terms, these CATEGORIES are always denied:\n"
    "   - Infrastructure identifiers: IP addresses, ports, hostnames, API keys, session IDs, commit SHAs\n"
    "   - Media services: streaming, downloading, media automation, media management\n"
    "   - Real estate: property searches, listings, addresses, house hunting\n"
    "   - PII: phone numbers, email addresses, real names of ANY contacts or people (except the system builder in the about section)\n"
    "   - Contact info: chat IDs, group IDs, phone numbers\n"
    "   When in doubt, OMIT. Never mention what was filtered — just skip it entirely.\n\n"
    "4. PLAN CONTENT: Before writing HTML, plan the gazette as structured notes:\n"
    "   Lead article: kicker, headline, 1-sentence summary, 150-250 word body with a pull-quote\n"
    "   2 dispatch articles: kicker, headline, 60-100 word summary\n"
    "   3-4 briefing items: headline + 1-2 sentence description\n"
    "   Editor's desk: 2-3 sentences, 50-80 words\n"
    "   Valid kickers: INFRASTRUCTURE, MESSAGING, SESSION MANAGEMENT, HEALTH, DEVELOPMENT, AUTOMATION, OPERATIONS\n"
    "   SPARSE DATA: If total messages.received < 10 AND tasks list is empty AND git_commits is empty, "
    "generate a 'quiet day' edition — focus on uptime/stability themes, system health metrics, shorter content.\n"
    "   ERROR: If gather-daily-data exits non-zero or returns {\"error\": ...}, generate a minimal edition "
    "noting data was unavailable with a brief system status.\n\n"
    "5. WRITE HTML: Fill the template structure with the planned content.\n"
    "   Dateline format: 'Vol. 1 · [Full weekday], [Month] [Day], [Year]' (e.g., 'Vol. 1 · Friday, March 21, 2026')\n"
    "   Use drop-cap class on the lead article's first paragraph.\n"
    "   Include a pull-quote in the lead article.\n"
    "   Use ABSOLUTE font paths: /pages/times/fonts/source-serif-4.woff2\n\n"
    "6. OPSEC VERIFICATION (MANDATORY): Run the deterministic verifier:\n"
    "   uv run ~/code/svenflow.ai/scripts/verify-opsec ~/code/svenflow.ai/pages/times/index.html\n"
    "   This checks ALL blocklist terms PLUS pattern-based detection (phone, email, IP, UUID, git SHA).\n"
    "   If it reports violations, fix them in the HTML and re-run verify-opsec until it prints CLEAN.\n"
    "   Do NOT proceed to deploy until verify-opsec exits with code 0.\n\n"
    "7. ARCHIVE: Run: uv run ~/code/svenflow.ai/scripts/archive-edition\n"
    "   This deterministic script archives yesterday's edition and updates editions.json. Do not do this manually.\n\n"
    "8. DEPLOY: cd ~/code/svenflow.ai && npm run build && bash deploy.sh\n"
    "   If deploy fails, do NOT retry. Log the error and exit.\n\n"
    "9. Do NOT send any SMS notification — this runs silently."
